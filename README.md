<h2>Empower Orphans</h2> 
<p>Empower Orphans is a fundraising platform dedicated to supporting orphaned children worldwide by working with organizations like the Children's Aid Society of Ottawa. Our mission is to create opportunities for underprivileged children by providing them with the resources they need to thrive. Through community engagement, fundraising initiatives, and donor support, we aim to make a lasting impact on the lives of those in need.</p>

<h3>What's Coming in V2</h3>
<p>The next version of Empower Orphans will bring a modernized and more engaging experience for donors and supporters. We are transitioning to React or Vue with Vite to improve performance, scalability, and accessibility. A secure donation system will be integrated directly into the site, allowing for seamless contributions. Additionally, backend functionality will enable dynamic content management and user authentication, while Three.js will enhance the platform with immersive 3D visuals. These upgrades will create a more interactive, efficient, and impactful platform, ensuring long-term growth and engagement.</p>
